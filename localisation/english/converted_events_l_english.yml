 conv.political.1.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 conv.political.1.b:0 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 conv.political.1.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 conv.political.1.t:0 "Communism on the Rise"
 conv.political.10.c:0 "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 conv.political.10.d:0 "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 conv.political.10.t:0 "Communists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.11.c:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 conv.political.11.d:0 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 conv.political.11.t:0 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.12.c:0 "The will of the people is to hold a referendum? Good, let's show them that the masses won't believe the fat of the wealthy."
 conv.political.12.d:0 "The day has come, [Root.GetLeader]. The wealthy now spread their ideas throughout [Root.GetName] and the people does now demand a referendum. They want the current regime, deemed by them as immoral and socialist, to be removed."
 conv.political.12.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Bourgeoise demanding referendum"
 conv.political.13.a:0 "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 conv.political.13.b:0 "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 conv.political.13.d:0 "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 conv.political.13.t:0 "Communists Rise Up"
 conv.political.14.a:0 "We will stop them at any cost!"
 conv.political.14.b:0 "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.14.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 conv.political.14.t:0 "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 conv.political.15.a:0 "They'll regret the day they forgot the State still exists even without them."
 conv.political.15.b:0 "We have a small loan of one million dollars thanks to our left-leaning policies. Better to have the economy led by these experts."
 conv.political.15.d:0 "The plague of Anarchic Capitalism spread anywhere in [Root.GetName] and so, after having tried a diplomatic solution and having failed, they are now boycotting the current regime and took up arms they bought to destroy us."
 conv.political.15.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] economy is being boycotted!"
 conv.political.16.a:0 "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 conv.political.16.d:0 "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 conv.political.16.t:0 "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 conv.political.17.a:0 "What a bunch of clowns."
 conv.political.17.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 conv.political.17.t:0 "Fascists Ridiculed"
 conv.political.18.a:0 "Who's the "a small loan of a million dollars" now, uh?"
 conv.political.18.d:0 "After having conquered their main center, the rebellious Capitalists had no more enough money to keep their rabbles march. Their bankruptcy is now seen by our loyal people as the sign of their ineptitude and that the State is needed as much as oxygen is."
 conv.political.18.t:0 "Anarchic Capitalists ended their funds"
 conv.political.19.a:0 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.19.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 conv.political.19_communism:0 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. This country has always stood on it principles and been ready to defend them. We are no longer safe on our own. Neutrality is no longer the safe haven it used to be and those who seek power in this world do not respect it. We must stand with our communist brothers against the powers that seek to oppress us. Against the bourgeois majority who wants nothing more than keep us down. If we do not take a stand, we will perish alone.'"

We are no longer safe on our own. We must stand with our fascist partners against our enemies. If we do not choose a side, we will perish alone.'"
 conv.political.19_radical:0 "The bankers are the only ones to trust. Time for Anarchic Capitalism to take over [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.2.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 conv.political.2.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 conv.political.2.d:0 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 conv.political.2.t:0 "Fascism on the Rise"
 conv.political.3.a:0 "Maybe the government can learn from them?"
 conv.political.3.b:0 "The economy, fools!"
 conv.political.3.d:0 "People are sick of the government, whether it is a monarchy or a republic. They're slowly gathering to spread together this idea"
 conv.political.3.t:0 "Radicalism on the Rise"
 conv.political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 conv.political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 conv.political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 conv.political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 conv.political.6.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 conv.political.6.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 conv.political.6.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 conv.political.7.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 conv.political.7.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 conv.political.7.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 conv.political.8.a:0 "Our only hope is that they won't organize a coup against us"
 conv.political.8.d:0 "[Root.GetName] has always been filled up by capitalist ideas. However, new groups of more liberal economists are supporting the idea of totally removing the State from the life of our people and this idea is slowly getting support in the wealthy classes of [Root.GetName]. What should the government do about this, however, is difficult to tell."
